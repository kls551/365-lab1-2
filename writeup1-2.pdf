1) Kaitlin Bleich, Kyaw Soe
2) We decided to stick with the old program and add on to it, instead of starting anew.
   Soe worked in IntelliJ and Kaitlin worked on the Cal Poly servers in vim. The program
   was written in Java.

5) We almost parsed both files and appended teacher information to each student array accordingly.
   However, we decided to simply treat them as separate entities and use elements of each as keys
   to indicate what part of the other data set we wanted. This meant that we had to have two 2D arrays,
   one for students and one for teachers. To accomodate new inputs, we simply added the extra switch cases.
   This didn't impact much other than the length of the program.
6) New commands:
   CS: | ClassroomS: <room #>
      ~ lists all students assigned to a room number
   CT: <room #>
      ~ lists all teachers teaching in that room
   GT: <grade>
      ~ lists all teachers teaching a grade
   R
      ~ reports enrollments broken down by classroom
   Stat | Statistics
      ~ lists:
      average GPA per grade
      average GPA per teacher 
      average GPA per bus route
